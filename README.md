This project will be delivered using Scrum methodology. As defined by the Scrum Alliance, this methodology includes the following ceremonies:

Sprint Planning

This is a meeting that includes the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development team. The purpose is to determine what items will be included for completion in the upcoming sprint. This is based on a combination of priorities as determined by the Product Owner and capacity as determined by the development team. The Scrum Master or the Product Owner can facilitate this meeting, as appropriate.

Inputs: 
- A complete, prioritized backlog of outstanding User Stories and Issues. Each item must include a unique priority and a clear "definition of done".
- The latest product increment that was delivered in the previous sprint (if applicable).
- Projected capacity of the Development Team during the upcoming sprint.
- Any known constraints on team velocity (any internal or external factors that will limit the team's capacity to complete sprint items.

Outputs: 
- The sprint goal: a verbal description of what will be accomplished in the upcoming sprint.
- The sprint backlog: a prioritized list of items which the development team will deliver within the upcoming sprint.

Daily Scrum

The daily Scrum meeting is a timeboxed (ideally 15 minutes) meeting during which each team member will share the following:
- What he/she accomplished yesterday
- What he/she plans to accomplish today
- What impediments (if any) need to be addressed that are blocking successful completion of one or more items of work.

The meeting is intended to be short and focused. Although quick questions can be addressed during Scrum, longer discussions should be deferred until after the meeting.  During the daily Scrum, the Scrum Master will note any impediments affecting the team, that need to be resolved and removed. The Scrum Master will also track progress against the Sprint Backlog and ensure transparency across the organization.

Sprint Review

This meeting takes place near the end of a sprint, when the completed items are ready to be demonstrated for the Product Owner. The team will demo the new functionality in the product increment and the Product Owner will determine whether or not the "definition of done" criteria have been met and the product increment is accepted. Additional stakeholders may be invited to this meeting as appropriate. This meeting is typically facilitated by the Scrum Master or a member of the development team.

Inputs: 
- A completed product increment that is ready to be demonstrated for the Product Owner.
- The sprint backlog, including acceptance criteria ("Definition of done") for each item.

Outputs: 
- Verbal and/or written certification from the Product Owner that the product increment is accepted, or documentation of issues to be addressed and how they will be addressed (e.g., corrected during this sprint, moved to the product backlog, cancelled, etc.)
- A revised Product Backlog based on decisions made during the Sprint Review.

Sprint Retrospective

This meeting is analogous to the "Lessons Learned" or "Project Post-Mortem" typically held at the end of traditional waterfall projects. It provides an opportunity for the Scrum Master, Product Owner and development team to evaluate the just-completed sprint. The purpose is to identify what went well and how those successes can be repeated in future sprints. Likewise, the team will collectively identify things that did not go well and need improvement. The entire group can brainstorm proposed process improvements that can be implemented and may also evaluate how well previously planned improvements were implemented. It's helpful to set some ground rules so that the Sprint Retrospective produces honest feedback and continuous improvement, without degenerating into personal conflicts between team members. This meeting is typically facilitated by the Scrum Master and should be interactive, with participation from every team member.

Inputs: 
- A completed product increment that has been accepted the Product Owner (or non-acceptance and reasons why documented, if applicable).
- The presence of the entire team, if possible.
- An agreement that each participant will be open to honest feedback, including criticism where appropriate.
- An understanding that there will be no retaliaton for feedback shared during the Sprint Retrospective.
- Action items from the previous Sprint Retrospective.
- Documented results from the just-completed sprint (e.g., team velocity, items accepted, items not accepted, statistical results).
- Each team member's observations and feedback concerning the just-completed sprint and suggestions for future sprints.
- A structured format for the meeting. This is usually chosen by the Scrum Master and can vary from sprint to sprint. There are many established formats that can be utilized.

Outputs:
- A list of things that went well during the sprint and positive feedback for team members as appropriate.
- A list of things that need improvement for future sprints.
- Planned action items and process changes for the next sprint (with specific responsibilities assigned).



Outputs: 
- Verbal and/or written certification from the Product Owner that the product increment is accepted, or documentation of issues to be addressed and how they will be addressed (e.g., corrected during this sprint, moved to the product backlog, cancelled, etc.)
- A revised Product Backlog based on decisions made during the Sprint Review.
